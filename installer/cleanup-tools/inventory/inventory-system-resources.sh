# Produces an inventory (recorded in a subdirectory) of selected cluster-scoped
# resources that are created by an MCE or ACM hub instnace.  Intended to be used
# to do a before/after anaysis to catch "leaked" resources.
#
# An example usage sequence might be:
#
# (1) Run on a fresh OCP cluster, and save results in a "fresh-ocp" directory.
# (2) Install MCE and ACM
# (3) Run again to caputre thiings as they are now into a "after-acm" directory.
# (4) Use companion diff-resource-inventrooy.sh script to identify the diffs
#     between "fresh-ocp" and "after-acm" to see what MCE/ACM created.
# (5) Uninstall and or do a forced-cleanup of MCE/ACM.
# (6) Run again to caputre things as they now are into a "after-uninstall" directory.
# (7) Use diff-resource-inventory.sh ti identify the changes between "fresh-ocp"
#     and "fater-uninstall" to see what has been left behind after the ininstall/cleanup.
#
# Requires:
# - Bash V4
# - oc
# - grep
# - sort
#
# Notes:
#
# - The list of resource types inventoried is based on ACM 2.7 and 2.8 (and corresp.
#   MCE 2.2 and 2.3) and may need to be updated for subsequent releases.
#
# - Also, we have not yet verified that this list is complete/comprehensive but it
#   is at least a very good first stab.
#
# - This script makes no attempt to identify cluster resources that exist but are
#   modified by ACM or MCE.  (One known example of such a moifications is the
#   cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap in the openshift-monitoring namespace.)
